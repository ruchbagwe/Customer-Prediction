# Customer-Prediction
Predict the client for a Bank who will subscribe a term deposite

This case study aims to increase the efficiency of the marketing campaign by predicting whether the client will subscribe to a term deposit. Furthermore, we have done an inferential analysis to find out the potential factors for a successful campaign.

### Problem Statement-
A Portuguese bank institute plans to run phone marketing campaigns to persuade customers to subscribe its term deposits. Success rate for such campaign is usually as low as 11%. Often, more than one contact to the same clients is made. Making phone calls not only requires manpower, money and time, but also has drawbacks including leading to negative customer attitudes and intrusion of customers’ privacy. The bank wants an accurate model for targeting customers so that it can gain the constant support from old customers and win term deposits market from new customers with minimized resources. The business problem is whether it is possible to predict the outcome of phone calls based on prospects’ demographic information beforehand. It is important because then fewer numbers of contacts are needed to achieve the same number of subscriptions.

The study is divided into the following 2 parts:

### Part I - Exploratory Data Analysis
        In this step, we studied the relation of feature among themselves and with the output. Also we clean the data.
### Part II -  Predictive Modeling
            In this step , we implemented multiple classification algorithms and evaluated model's sensitivity.

### Conclusion
